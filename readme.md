Exploratory MSE for ple.27.7e - 2021
================

## Introduction

This repository contains the scripts for an exploratory Management
Strategy Evaluation for Western English Channel plaice (ple.27.7e).

The operating model is created using the SAM
[`stockassessment`](https://github.com/fishfollower/SAM/) R package and
follows the principles developed during the ICES Workshop on North Sea
stocks management strategy evaluation
([WKNSMSE](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.5090)).

The simulation is based on the Fisheries Library in R
([FLR](http://www.flr-project.org/)) and the Assessment for All (a4a)
standard MSE framework ([`FLR/mse`](github.com/FLR/mse)) developed
during the Workshop on development of MSE algorithms with R/FLR/a4a
([Jardim et al.,
2017](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/assessment-all-initiativea4a-workshop-development-mse-algorithms-rflra4a)).

The data-limited MSE framework is based on Fischer et
al.Â ([2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab018)), see the
[`shfischer/GA_MSE`](https://github.com/shfischer/GA_MSE) GitHub
repository for the original source code and documentation.

## Repository structure

The root folder contains the following R scripts:

-   `OM*.R`: Scripts for creating the operating model (OM)
    -   `OM_SAM_fit.R` script for configuring and running SAM,
    -   `OM_Eqsim.R` runs EqSim on SAM model fit to create ICES style
        reference points,
    -   `OM_length.R` preparation of length data for the generation of
        the length index for the rfb rule,
    -   `OM.R` generate the operating model(s),
    -   `OM_MSY.R` calculation of real MSY reference points with the mse
        framework,
-   `funs.R` contains functions and methods used for the creation of the
    operating models and the modules of the MSE,
-   `funs_GA.R` functions for running the MSE within the genetic
    algorithm and calculate summary statistics and fitness values,
-   `funs_WKNSMSE.R` mse modules for running the category 1 SAM-based
    ICES MSY rule,
-   `MP_run.R` an R script for running MSE projections with the genetic
    algorithm, usually called from a job submission script (`*.pbs`),
-   `MP_analysis.R` script for analysing the results.

The following input files are provided:

-   `input/model_input_stk_d.rds` contains the XSA stock input data,
-   `input/model_input_idx.rds` contains the XSA survey index input
    data,
-   `input/stock.rds` contains the XSA model fit from WGCSE 2021 for the
    landings only assessment,
-   `input/stock_d.rds` contains the XSA model fit from WGCSE 2021 for
    the total catch assessment,
-   `input/fit.rds` SAM model fit,
-   `input/length/ALKs.csv` age-length keys, used for generating the
    length index,
-   `input/ple.27.7e/baseline/1000_20/input_rfb.rds` default mse input
    object for running the rfb rule.

The framework is based on the Fisheries Library in R (FLR) framework.
The exact versions of the packages as used here can be installed with
`remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLCore", ref = "3d694903b9e6717b86c3e8486fc14ebf92908786")
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/FLash", ref = "d1fb86fa081aaa5b6980d74b07d9adb44ad19a7f") # silenced version of FLash
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLBRP", ref = "3a4d6390abc56870575fbaba3637091036468217")
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLAssess", ref = "14c7752efcc5a2f463d0e9846be33b327c77b59b")
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/FLXSA", ref = "40756e4d1eb60a0ab50d6e511477a8ee8dde2373")
remotes::install_github(repo = "flr/ggplotFL")
```

Furthermore, a data-limited fork of the `flr/mse` package is required:

``` r
remotes::install_github(repo = "shfischer/mse", ref = "mseDL2.0")
```

For the generation of the operating model, the SAM
[`stockassessment`](https://github.com/fishfollower/SAM/) R package from
GitHub is required:

-   `stockassessment` 0.10.0

Install this version with

``` r
install.packages("TMB") ### required to use stockassessment
devtools::install_github("fishfollower/SAM/stockassessment", ref = "6ddb31ffee0d867c569a86cd4dc7a9ba8243764c")
```

In order to use SAM within FLR, the functionality of the inofficial
package `FLfse` is used:

-   `FLfse` 1.0

``` r
devtools::install_github("shfischer/FLfse/FLfse", ref = "64cec8ee86c9309a5b4e84ff1790d0ed594bc7ee")
```

Furthermore, some more R packages available from CRAN are required:

``` r
install.packages(c("foreach", "DoParallel", "doRNG", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "Cairo", "scales")) 
```
